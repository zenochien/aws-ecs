Whether you are part of a large enterprise or a startup, Amazon ECS offers a variety of tools that can help you to get your containers up and running quickly, regardless of your level of expertise. You can work with Amazon ECS in the following ways.

- Learn about, develop, manage and visualize your container applications and services using the [AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-console).

- Perform specific actions to Amazon ECS resources with automated deployments through programming or scripts using the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-awscli), [AWS SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-sdks) or the ECS API.

- Define and manage all AWS resources in your environment with automated deployment using [AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-cfn).

- Use the complete AWS Copilot CLI end-to-end developer workflow to create, release, and operate container applications that comply with AWS best practices for infrastructure.

- Using your preferred programming language, define infrastructure or architecture as code with the AWS CDK.

- Containerize applications that are hosted on premises or on Amazon EC2 instances or both by using the [AWS App2Container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-a2c) integrated portability and tooling ecosystem for containers.

- Launch containers from [Docker Desktop integration with Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-developer-tools.html#developer-tools-dockercli) using Amazon ECS in Docker Desktop.
